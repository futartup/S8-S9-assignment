# Train CIFAR10 with PyTorch resnet18 model

This repo is subjected to submission of assignment S8. It implements resnet18 model. 
The target is to acheive 85% accuracy in any number of epochs.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.0+

## Accuracy
| Model             | Acc.        |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| [ResNet18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)          | 93.02%      |


## Learning rate adjustment
